#  Student Grades Management System
# â€¢ Create a program that allows users to input student names and grades. The program should be
# able to calculate the class average, highest and lowest grades, and display all students' grades.
# â€¢ Bonus: Add features such as grade categorization (e.g., A, B, C) and handling missing data.
# â€¢ Focus Areas: Lists, dictionaries, loops, conditional logic, and file handling (optional).
